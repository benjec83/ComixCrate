//

//Thank you for providing the repository. I'll start by examining the main components of the app and then suggest refactoring and improvements.
//
//Here's the structure I'll follow:
//
//1. **Review the Data Model**: Ensure that the Core Data model is set up correctly and efficiently.
//2. **Review the Helpers**: Check the helper functions and classes for efficiency, clarity, and potential improvements.
//3. **Review the Views**: Examine the SwiftUI views for best practices, clarity, and potential improvements.
//4. **General Code Quality**: Look for any code smells, redundancies, or areas that can be improved for clarity and efficiency.
//
//Let's begin with the **Data Model**:
//
//1. **LibraryData.xcdatamodeld**: This is the Core Data model. I'll check its entities, attributes, and relationships.
//
//Next, I'll move on to the **Helpers**:
//
//2. **ComicFileHandler.swift**: This handles the importing of comic files.
//3. **CoreDataHelper.swift**: Contains helper functions related to Core Data operations.
//4. **DocumentPicker.swift**: SwiftUI view for picking documents.
//5. **FavoriteButton.swift**: A button for marking favorites.
//6. **ImageUtilities.swift**: Utilities related to image operations.
//7. **LRUCache.swift**: A least recently used cache implementation.
//8. **Persistence.swift**: Core Data stack setup.
//9. **ProgressDialogView.swift**: The progress dialog view.
//10. **ProgressModel.swift**: The model for tracking progress.
//11. **ThumbnailProvider.swift**: Provides thumbnails for the comic files.
//
//Lastly, I'll review the **Views**:
//
//12. **BookDetails.swift**: Details of a book.
//13. **BookSheetView.swift**: A sheet view for a book.
//14. **BookTileModel.swift**: A tile model for a book.
//15. **ContentView.swift**: The main content view.
//16. **DatabaseInspectorView.swift**: A view for inspecting the database.
//17. **DiagnosticView.swift**: A diagnostic view.
//18. **LibraryView.swift**: The main library view.
//
//I'll start by examining the Core Data model (`LibraryData.xcdatamodeld`).
//
//I've reviewed the Core Data model (`LibraryData.xcdatamodeld`). Here are my observations:
//
//1. **Entities**: The model contains several entities like `Book`, `BookCreatorRole`, `Characters`, `Creator`, `Event`, `Format`, `Imprint`, `Locations`, `Page`, `Publisher`, `ReadingList`, `Series`, and `StoryArc`. Each entity has its attributes and relationships defined.
//
//2. **Attributes**: Each entity has a set of attributes that define its properties. For instance, the `Book` entity has attributes like `title`, `fileName`, `thumbnailPath`, `isFavorite`, and more.
//
//3. **Relationships**: Relationships between entities are well-defined. For example, the `Book` entity has relationships with `BookCreatorRole`, `Characters`, `Event`, `Format`, `Imprint`, `Locations`, `Publisher`, `Series`, and `StoryArc`.
//
//4. **Deletion Rules**: The deletion rules are set to `Nullify` for most relationships, which means if the source object is deleted, the destination object will not be deleted but will have its relationship to the source nullified.
//
//Overall, the Core Data model seems well-structured and comprehensive. However, there are a few things to consider:
//
//- **Redundancy**: Ensure that there's no redundancy in the data model. For example, if two entities have similar attributes, consider merging them or creating a parent entity.
//  
//- **Optimization**: Depending on the size of the dataset, you might want to optimize the fetch requests. Indexing certain attributes can speed up search operations.
//
//- **Relationship Cardinality**: Ensure that the relationships' cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) is correctly set up based on the app's requirements.
//
//Next, I'll move on to the **Helpers** and start by examining `ComicFileHandler.swift`. This file handles the importing of comic files, which is crucial for the progress update issue you're facing.
//
//I've reviewed the `ComicFileHandler.swift` file. Here are my observations and suggestions:
//
//1. **handleImportedFile Function**:
//   - This function is responsible for handling the imported comic files. It unzips the comic file, reads the `ComicInfo.xml`, and then processes the images.
//   - The function uses `DispatchQueue.main.async` to update the `progressModel` on the main thread. This is correct, as UI updates should be done on the main thread.
//   - The function saves the context after processing all the images. This might be one of the reasons for the delay in updating the UI. Consider saving the context after processing each image or after processing a batch of images.
//
//2. **parseComicInfoXML Function**:
//   - This function parses the `ComicInfo.xml` file and returns a `ComicInfo` struct with the parsed data.
//   - The parsing is done using the `XMLParser` class, and the `ComicInfoXMLParserDelegate` class is used as the delegate for the parser.
//
//3. **ComicInfo Struct**:
//   - This struct represents the data parsed from the `ComicInfo.xml` file. It contains properties like `series`, `number`, `web`, `summary`, `publisher`, `title`, `coverImageName`, and `year`.
//
//4. **ComicInfoXMLParserDelegate Class**:
//   - This class is the delegate for the `XMLParser` and is responsible for parsing the `ComicInfo.xml` file.
//   - The parsing logic seems straightforward and follows the standard approach for XML parsing in Swift.
//
//**Suggestions**:
//
//1. **Refactor handleImportedFile Function**:
//   - Consider breaking down the `handleImportedFile` function into smaller functions. This will make the code more readable and maintainable.
//   - For example, the logic for unzipping the comic file, reading the `ComicInfo.xml`, and processing the images can be separated into individual functions.
//
//2. **Optimize Image Processing**:
//   - Currently, the function processes all images sequentially. Consider using a concurrent approach to process multiple images simultaneously. This can speed up the import process.
//   - Use `DispatchQueue.concurrentPerform` to process images concurrently.
//
//3. **Error Handling**:
//   - Improve error handling by providing more descriptive error messages and handling specific error scenarios.
//   - For example, handle cases where the `ComicInfo.xml` file is missing or corrupted.
//
//4. **Code Comments**:
//   - Add code comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each function and class. This will make the code more understandable for other developers.
//
//5. **Use Constants**:
//   - Instead of using hardcoded strings like "jpg", "png", and "ComicInfo.xml", consider defining them as constants at the beginning of the file.
//
//6. **Optimize Core Data Operations**:
//   - As mentioned earlier, consider saving the context more frequently during the import process. This can help in updating the UI in real-time.
//
//I'll proceed with refactoring the `ComicFileHandler.swift` file based on the above suggestions. Would you like me to implement these changes directly, or would you prefer a step-by-step guide on how to make these changes?
